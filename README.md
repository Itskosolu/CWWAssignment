        <div class="simple-div">
            I would like to start of by thanking CWW Tech Africa for this amazing opportunity.<br/> I am a graduate of
            History and Diplomatic Studies from the University of Port Harcourt. I recently resigned from my job as 
            a Secetary because of the unfavorable working conditions and in a rapidly evolving world driven by technology,
            i decided it was time for a career change.
        <p>The tech world can be intimidating, especially for those like me coming from non-technical backgrounds, but
            nothing is without its challenges.<br/> I am happy for the choices that i have made and the steps that i have 
            taken for my self development.<br/>With my unique blend of skills, passion, and tenacity, i am poised to make
            a profound impact in the tech world, paving the way for others who dare to dream beyond their chosen paths.</p>
